Dockerfiles for generating container images for the E-prover. Two folders:

1) build (tag as "eprover-build")
- Full image for building E prover from sources (depends on the "alpine-build" image, whose Dockerfile is found in the folder: "../../base-build/alpine-build").
- Both first-order and higher-order E executables are generated and copied in: "/artifacts/eprover" and "/artifacts/eprover-ho" respectively.

2) distr (tag as "eprover")
- Minimalist image based upon Linux Alpine for distributing E prover (depends on the "eprover-build" image).
- Default entrypoint is "/usr/bin/eprover-ho" (can be overriden with flag "--entrypoint /usr/bin/eprover").


Build Steps (from scratch):
>> podman build -t alpine-build <PATH_TO_alpine-build_FOLDER>
>> podman build -t eprover-build <PATH_TO_eprover/build_FOLDER>
>> podman build -t eprover <PATH_TO_eprover/distr_FOLDER>


Example: Solving a proof problem (problems/lusk.p)

Run using "eprover-build" image:
>> podman run --rm -v $PWD/problems:/problems --entrypoint /artifacts/eprover-ho eprover-build /problems/lusk.p

Run using "eprover" image:
>> podman run --rm -v $PWD/problems:/problems eprover /problems/lusk.p
