Dockerfiles for generating container images for the Vampire prover (without Z3). Two folders:

1) build (tag as "vampire-build")
- Full image for building Vampire prover from sources (depends on the "minideb-build" image, whose Dockerfile is found in the folder: "../../base-build/minideb-build").
- Vampire executable is generated in: "/bin/vampire_rel_HEAD_1" and later copied to "/artifacts/vampire_rel_HEAD_1".
- Builds without Z3 support (TODO: fix this)

2) distr (tag as "vampire")
- Image based upon a minimalist Debian distribution (minideb) for distributing Vampire prover (depends on the "vampire-build" image).
- Default entrypoint is "/usr/bin/vampire" (can be overriden with flag "--entrypoint").


Build Steps (from scratch):
>> podman build -t minideb-build <PATH_TO_minideb-build_FOLDER>
>> podman build -t vampire-build <PATH_TO_vampire/build_FOLDER>
>> podman build -t vampire <PATH_TO_vampire/distr_FOLDER>


Example: Solving a proof problem (problems/dat.p)

Run using "vampire-build" image:
>> podman run --rm -v $PWD/problems:/problems --entrypoint /artifacts/vampire_rel_HEAD_1 vampire-build /problems/dat.p

Run using "vampire" image:
>> podman run --rm -v $PWD/problems:/problems vampire /problems/dat.p
