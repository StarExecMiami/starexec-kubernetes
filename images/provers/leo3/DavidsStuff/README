Dockerfiles for generating container images for the Leo-III prover. Two folders:

1) build (tag as "leo3-build")
- Full image for building Leo-III prover from sources (depends on the "scala-build" image, whose Dockerfile is found in the folder: "../../base-build/scala-build").
- Leo-III executable is generated in: "/bin/leo3" and later copied to "/artifacts/leo3" (same with leo3.jar).

2) distr (tag as "leo3")
- Image based upon a minimalist Alpine distribution + jre11 for distributing Leo-III prover (depends on the "leo3-build" image).
- Default entrypoint is "/usr/bin/vampire" (can be overriden with flag "--entrypoint").


Build Steps (from scratch):
>> podman build -t scala-build <PATH_TO_scala-build_FOLDER>
>> podman build -t leo3-build <PATH_TO_leo3/build_FOLDER>
>> podman build -t leo3 <PATH_TO_leo3/distr_FOLDER>


Example: Solving a proof problem (problems/sur_cantor.p)

Run using "leo3-build" image:
>> podman run --rm -v $PWD/problems:/problems --entrypoint /artifacts/leo3 leo3-build /problems/sur_cantor.p

Run using "leo3" image:
>> podman run --rm -v $PWD/problems:/problems leo3 /problems/sur_cantor.p

Or via stdin (FIXME: parsing problem produces GiveUp)
>> cat problems/sur_cantor.p | podman run --rm leo3 -
