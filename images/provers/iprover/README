Dockerfiles for generating container images for iProver. Two folders:

1) build (tag as "iprover-build") -- FAILS!
- Full image for building iProver from sources (depends on the "ocaml-build" image, whose Dockerfile is found in the folder: "../../base-build/ocaml-build").
- Building the image currently takes too long and often fails mysteriously!

2) distr (tag as "iprover") -- TODO


Example: Solving a proof problem (TODO)
